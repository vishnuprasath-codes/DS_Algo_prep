/*
ðŸ“Œ Revision Notes (Sieve of Eratosthenes):
1. Start by assuming all numbers are prime.
2. Mark 0 and 1 as not prime.
3. For each prime p (from 2 to sqrt(n)):
   - Mark multiples of p (p*p, p*p+p, ...) as not prime.
4. Collect all numbers still marked as prime into result.
5. Time Complexity: O(n log log n), Space: O(n).
